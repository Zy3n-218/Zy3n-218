# Scenario
Wireshark is a free open-source network packet analyzing software. It is one of the most used network monitoring and analyzing tool. In this exercise we will get familiarity with Wireshark and explore what information we can obtain from the captured network packets. We will use the default Wireshark installed on our Linux distro.(Kali Linux)

## Objective
* Gain familiarity with Wireshark tool
*	Understand the basics of network (TCP) packets analysis

## HTTP Capture: Steps Taken 
1.	Open Wireshark by selecting it from “Application” list. Make sure you check the “Enable promiscuous mode on all interfaces” in its ‘Settings’.
2.  Enter  http  in the display-filter-specification window, so that only HTTP messages will be displayed in the packet-listing window. 
3.	Wait for a brief moment (a few seconds) and then click on to begin packet capture.
4.	Quickly go back to the browser you started earlier and enter http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/HTTP-wireshark-file1.html. 
5.	Stop Wireshark packet capture after a few seconds.

## Solutions
1.	What version of HTTP is found in the communication?		
-	HTTP 1.1

2.	What languages (if any) does your browser indicate that it can accept from the server?
-	English (en-us)

3.	What are the IP addresses of your computer and the gaia.cs.umass.edu server? 		
-	Server: 128.119.245.12
-	Computer: 10.0.2.15

4.	How many bytes is the request from you? How did you identify/found?		
-	128 bytes; I found this by looking under the [Request URIhttp://gaia.cs.umass.edu/wireshark-labs/HTTP-wireshark-file1.html] for file data.

5.	What is the status code returned from the server to your browser? What does the status code mean?												
-	Status Code: 200 OK; the status code indicates a successful request.
  
6.	What is the web-server software and version on the host server you reached?		
-	Version on host server is IPv4; Web-server software: Apache

7.	What is the operating system on the server? 
-	The server is using Linux as its operating system

  8.	How many bytes of content are being returned to your browser? 				
-	107 bytes: 128bytes – 21 bytes (header)

## TCP Packet Capture

1.What is the IP address and TCP port number used by the client computer (source) that is transferring the file to gaia.cs.umass.edu?
- IP address: 10.0.2.15
- Src Port number: 39130

2. What is the sequence number of the TCP SYN segment that is used to initiate the TCP connection between the client computer and gaia.cs.umass.edu? What indicates/identifies that the segment as a SYN segment? 										
- Sequence #: 0
- In the info column, the TCP segment displays [SYN]. Also on the far left, in the No. column, there is a packet symbol that indicates that the segment is the first packet in the conversation.

3. What is the sequence number of the SYNACK segment sent by gaia.cs.umass.edu to the client computer in reply to the SYN? What is the value of the Acknowledgement field in the SYNACK segment? 										
- Sequence #: 0
- ACK = 1

5. In which frame the actual text (alice.txt) starts transferring to the server? At which frame the text transfer stopped? How many total bytes of text were transferred?				[6]
 
-	In my case, frame 120 is where the text transfer starts and frame 136 is where text transfer stops. There were 2804 total bytes transferred.
