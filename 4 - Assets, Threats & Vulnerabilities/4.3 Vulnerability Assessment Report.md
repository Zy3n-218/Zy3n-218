# Vulnerability Assessment

## System Description
The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

## Scope
The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 2024 to August 2024. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

## Purpose
Consider the following questions to help you write:
  * How is the database server valuable to the business?
  * Why is it important for the business to secure the data on the server?
  * How might the server impact the business if it were disabled?
    
The purpose of this risk assessment is to identify threats to the server, and evaluate potential risks to the business. The server plays an important role in keeping company and user data. The server being disabled  would be detrimental to business operations, causing damage to company reputation and possible fines and other legal fees.

## Risk Assessment
| Threat source | Threat Event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
| --- | --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | 
| Competitor | Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration | 1 | 3 | 3 | 
| Malicious Attacker| Conduct Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. | 2 | 3 | 6 | 
| Hacker | Conduct "man-in-the-middle" attacks | 3 | 3| 9 | 

## Approach
I selected these three threat sources and events because they pose significant risks to business operations, data integrity, and security. Malicious software conducting Denial of Service (DoS) attacks can cripple business systems, leading to downtime, loss of revenue, and reputational damage. A hacker executing a "man-in-the-middle" attack compromises sensitive communications, potentially exposing confidential business or customer data to unauthorized parties. Lastly, competitors obtaining sensitive information via exfiltration threaten a companyâ€™s competitive edge, leading to financial and strategic losses. Addressing these threats is critical to maintaining operational stability, customer trust, and overall business resilience.

## Remediation Strategy
To remediate or mitigate the identified risks, implementing a Defense in Depth strategy can help protect against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by using layered security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and traffic filtering. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) can reduce the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks by ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive systems, even if credentials are compromised. To prevent the exfiltration of sensitive information, enforcing the Principle of Least Privilege ensures that employees only have access to the data necessary for their roles, reducing insider threats and accidental leaks. Additionally, the Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) framework can enhance access control and monitoring, helping to detect and prevent unauthorized activities in real-time.
