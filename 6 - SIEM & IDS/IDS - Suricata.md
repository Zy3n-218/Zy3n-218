# Intrusion Detection System - Suricata

## Examining alerts, logs and rules with Suricata
In this scenario, you’re a security analyst who must monitor traffic on your employer's network. You’ll be required to configure Suricata and use it to trigger alerts.

Here’s how you'll do this task: First, you'll explore custom rules in Suricata. Second, you'll run Suricata with a custom rule in order to trigger it, and examine the output logs in the fast.log file. Finally, you’ll examine the additional output that Suricata generates in the standard eve.json log file.

For the purposes of the tests you’ll run in this lab activity, you’ve been supplied with a sample.pcap file and a custom.rules file. These reside in your home folder.

Let’s define the files you’ll be working with in this lab activity:

  * The `sample.pcap` file is a packet capture file that contains an example of network traffic data, which you’ll use to test the Suricata rules. This will allow you to simulate and repeat the exercise of monitoring network traffic.

  * The `custom.rules` file contains a custom rule when the lab activity starts. You’ll add rules to this file and run them against the network traffic data in the sample.pcap file.

  * The `fast.log` file will contain the alerts that Suricata generates. The fast.log file is empty when the lab starts. Each time you test a rule, or set of rules, against the sample network traffic data, Suricata adds a new alert line to the fast.log file when all the conditions in any of the rules are met. The fast.log file can be located in the /var/log/suricata directory after Suricata runs.The fast.log file is considered to be a depreciated format and is not recommended for incident response or threat hunting tasks but can be used to perform quick checks or tasks related to quality assurance.

  * The `eve.json` file is the main, standard, and default log for events generated by Suricata. It contains detailed information about alerts triggered, as well as other network telemetry events, in JSON format. The eve.json file is generated when Suricate runs, and can also be located in the /var/log/suricata directory.

When you create a new rule, you'll need to test the rule to confirm whether or not it worked as expected. You can use the `fast.log` file to quickly compare the number of alerts generated each time you run Suricata to test a signature against the `sample.pcap` file.

## Expectations
* Create custom rules and run them in Suricata
* Monitor traffic captured in a packet capture file
* Examine the `fast.log` and `eve.json` output

## Steps

1. Examine a custom rule in Suricata
<img width="710" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-02 at 12 46 32 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13803c67-8008-4eb7-b55b-af09cad6205b" />

* Action `alert` : Instructs to alert on selected network traffic. The IDS will inspect the traffic packets and send out an alert in case it matches.
* Header `http`: The rule that applies is only to HTTP traffic. The arrow indicates the direction of the traffic from $HOME_NET and going to the destination IP address $EXTERNAL_NET. In this scenario, $HOME_NET is a suricata variable defined in /etc/suricata/suricata/yaml as a rule definitions. $HOME_NET is definatd as the 172.21.224/0/20 subnet.
* Rule options `Rule`: Customize signatures with additional parameters.

  * The `msg`: The alert will print out the text GET on wire.
  * The `flow:established, to_server`: Determines that packet from the client to the server should be matched (The handshakes: SYN-ACK packet).
  * The `content`: "GET" tells Suricata to look for the word GET in the http.method of the packet.
  * The `sid:12345`: Unique numerical value that identify the rule.
  * The `rev:3` indicates the signature's version which is used to identify the signature's version.

2. Trigger a custom rule in Suricata
* List the files in the `/var/log/suricata` folder: `ls -l /var/log/suricata`. Up this task, there will be no files to be found.

* We run Suricata using the `custom.rules` and `sample.pcap`: `sudo suricata -r sample.pcap -S custom.rules -k none`.
  * The `-r sample.pcap` option specifies an input file to mimic network traffic. In this case, the sample.pcap file.
  * The `-S custom.rules` option instructs Suricata to use the rules defined in the custom.rules file.
  * The `-k none` option instructs Suricata to disable all checksum checks.

* List the files in the `/var/log/suricata` folder again: `ls -l /var/log/suricata`.

* Display `fast.log`: `cat /var/log/suricata/fast.log`

<img width="703" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-02 at 1 15 17 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ebab5b4-aba7-4dac-a2f3-9c20e5e86c60" />

Here, each line corresponds to an alert generated by Suricata when it processes a packet that meets the conditions of an alert generating rule. Each line consists of the rule triggered the alert, source, destination and direction of the traffic. 

3. Examine `eve.json` output.
* Use the cat command to display the entries in the `eve.json` file: `cat /var/log/suricata/eve.json`. The format of the data will be in JSON.

* Use the jq command to display the entries in an improved format: `jq . /var/log/suricata/eve/json | less`

 <img width="705" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-02 at 1 31 48 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1fa6916-576f-454b-8d9b-0ec4b566f8af" />

Extract specific event data from `eve.json` file: `jq -c "[.timestamp,.flow_id,.alert.signature,.proto,.dest_ip]" /var/log/suricata/eve.json`.
<img width="712" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-02 at 1 38 20 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c02dc649-05f8-49f0-ba1f-403697963f8e" />

4. Things found in the `eve.json`
* The value of the severity for the first alert returned by the `jq` command is 3.
* The destination IP address listed for the last event in the `eve.json` file is `142.250.1.102`.
* The alert signature for the first entry in the `eve.json` is `GET on WIRE`.
