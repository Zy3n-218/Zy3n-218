## Professional Statement
My name is Zyen Atkins. As a recent Computer Information Systems graduate from Valdosta State University, I am eager to deepen my expertise in cybersecurity and its applications across industries. I have recently completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate to prepare myself for work in the cybersecurity field, and am currently studying for the CompTIA Security+ exam as of March 2025.

## Portfolio
